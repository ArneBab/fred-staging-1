	 * container.ext().store(list, 2)
	 * 
	 * Otherwise everything contained in the arraylist is updated to depth 3, which
	 * is not usually what we want, and can be catastrophic due to storing deactivated
	 * objects and/or using up lots of memory. */
	
	/* http://tracker.db4o.com/browse/COR-1582
	 * Never activate a HashMap to depth 1. This will not only result in its being 
	 * empty, but activating it to depth 2 and thus loading its elements will not be 
	 * possible unless you deactivate it first. Combined with the previous bug this
	 * can cause *really* annoying bugs: maps apparently spontaneously clearing 
	 * themselves, actual cause was it was accidentally activated to depth 1, and then
	 * was accidentally stored by e.g. being moved from one ArrayList to another with
	 * the previous bug. */

	 * there seem to be random object disappearances, there are many many horrible 
	 * things... */
